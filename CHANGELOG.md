# Changelog

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Security Audit (Pro):** the TUI mirror of the BrewBar OSV bug. `osv-api.ts`
  was sending `ecosystem: 'Homebrew'` to OSV.dev, which rejects that value with
  HTTP 400, so every Security Audit run silently returned zero CVEs. Switched
  to `Bitnami` (same approach already used by `SecurityMonitor.swift`).
  Packages outside Bitnami's catalog return empty results instead of failing
  the whole batch.
- **`brew-tui install-brewbar`:** the bundled download URL pointed at the old
  `MoLinesGitHub` org. GitHub still serves a 301 redirect, but stricter HTTP
  clients can fail. Updated to `MoLinesDesigns/Brew-TUI/releases/latest/...`.
- **Homebrew Cask:** `brewbar` was stuck at 0.1.0 with the same outdated org
  URL — the cask was effectively unusable. Bumped to 0.6.1 with the SHA256 of
  the published release zip and the corrected URL.

### Internal
- Repository URLs across `package.json`, `README`, the formula, the cask, the
  issue template and the brewbar installer now point at `MoLinesDesigns/*`.
- `jsr.json` bumped 0.5.2 → 0.6.2 to follow npm.
- Stale 0.4.1 BrewBar artefacts (`BrewBar.app.zip`, `.dSYM`) removed from the
  repo working tree; they were already gitignored but had been committed
  earlier.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **BrewBar:** outdated count was always zero on systems with cask updates,
  so notifications never fired. `OutdatedPackage` required `pinned: Bool` but
  casks from `brew outdated --json=v2 --greedy` omit that field, making the
  whole JSON decode throw and the refresh abort silently. The decoder now
  treats `pinned` and `pinned_version` as optional and defaults `pinned` to
  `false`, matching the formula contract.
- **BrewBar:** CVE check spammed `OSV API returned HTTP 400` every hour
  because OSV does not accept `Homebrew` as an ecosystem. Switched to
  `Bitnami`, which covers most common OSS packages and filters by version
  correctly. Packages outside Bitnami's catalog return empty results
  instead of crashing the batch.
- **BrewBar:** consecutive outdated notifications were silently replaced
  in macOS Notification Center because every `UNNotificationRequest` reused
  the same identifier. Notifications now use a per-fire timestamped
  identifier so each one shows as a fresh banner.

### Internal
- `AppState.refresh()` now logs decoding/refresh errors via `os.Logger` so
  silent failures show up in `log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.molinesdesigns.brewbar"'`.
- `BrewBar` version bumped to 0.6.1.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **BrewBar:** outdated packages now reflect the current Homebrew formula index.
  Previously `brew update` was never run before `brew outdated`, so BrewBar
  could show zero updates while the terminal found packages to upgrade.
  `AppState.refresh()` now runs `brew update --quiet` first (non-fatal, 120s
  timeout) before the parallel outdated + services check.

### Internal
- `BrewChecker.updateIndex()` added — runs `brew update` without
  `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE` so the local tap index is always fresh.
- `BrewBar` version bumped to 0.4.2.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Upgrade prompt:** Tier-aware pricing copy. The prompt now branches by
  tier and points to the correct Polar checkout URL:
  - **Pro views** show €9.95/month or €82/year and link to the Pro Yearly
    Polar product.
  - **Team views** (Compliance) show €8/seat/month or €81.60/seat/year (min
    3 seats) and link to the Team Monthly Polar product with `quantity=3`.
- Account view monthly/yearly labels updated to canonical pricing.

### Internal
- New i18n keys `upgrade_teamFeature`, `upgrade_teamPricing`,
  `upgrade_buyUrlTeam`, `upgrade_teamLabel` for tier-aware copy.
- `UpgradePrompt` now consults `isTeamView()` to pick the right tier strings.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **License gating bug:** `isTeam()` returned true for Pro users, granting free access to Team Compliance. Now strict (`status === 'team'` only).
- **Plan persistence:** activate / initialize now propagate `license.plan` ('pro' or 'team') instead of hardcoding 'pro'. Combined with the new `detectPlan()` helper that infers tier from the license-key prefix (`BTUI-T-` → Team, `BTUI-` → Pro).
- **BrewBar menu bar icon:** the status item reserved extra horizontal space because the icon's native size was used and the badge string had a leading whitespace. Icon now forced to 18×18 pt and the badge collapses to truly empty when there is nothing to show.

### Added
- `POLAR_PRODUCT_IDS` and `POLAR_CHECKOUT_URLS` constants for the four live Polar products.
- 4 regression tests for plan detection.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added — Power Release (Phase 1-6)

- **CVE Real-time monitoring (Pro):** BrewBar polls OSV.dev hourly, shows ⚠N badge in menu bar and sends macOS notifications for new critical/high CVEs in installed packages. Click notification jumps to security-audit view.
- **Impact Analysis (Pro):** pre-upgrade risk panel (low/medium/high) showing dependency tree, breaking changes hint, and reverse-deps that will be affected. Surfaced in `outdated` view before each upgrade.
- **Smart Rollback (Pro):** automatic snapshots after every install/upgrade/uninstall/pin. Rollback view generates plans using bottle/versioned/pin strategies. `R` key in security-audit jumps to rollback for vulnerable packages.
- **Declarative Brewfile (Pro):** YAML-based desired state with drift score 0-100 and interactive reconciliation. High-risk upgrades hint to add the package to Brewfile first.
- **Cross-machine Sync (Pro):** iCloud Drive backend with AES-256-GCM encryption, per-machine identity, interactive conflict resolution, ⟳ drift badge in BrewBar. Post-sync success offers `c` shortcut to Compliance.
- **Team Compliance (Team tier):** PolicyFile JSON, score 0-100, severity-graded violations, automatic remediation plans. New `compliance` view (Team-gated, separate from Pro).
- **Dashboard Pro Status panel:** unified state of the 4 power modules (snapshots, Brewfile drift, sync, compliance).
- **`brew-tui status` CLI:** now shows snapshot count, Brewfile drift, sync state and compliance score.

### Internal
- New shared modules: `state-snapshot/`, `diff-engine/`, `impact/`, `rollback/`, `brewfile/`, `sync/` (with `crypto` + iCloud backend), `compliance/`.
- BrewBar `SyncMonitor.swift` + scheduler hooks for `cveMonitor` and `syncDriftCheck`.
- 205 tests across 20 test files (all passing).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- BrewBar auto-install + auto-launch on every `brew-tui` run for Pro users (macOS only).
- BrewBar auto-registers as a login item the first time it runs as Pro (idempotent; respects later opt-out from Settings).

### Changed
- BrewBar binary now signed with Developer ID + hardened runtime, notarized by Apple, and stapled — installs cleanly without Gatekeeper warnings.
- `LicenseChecker` (Swift) now recognizes built-in PRO accounts so they pass the Pro check in BrewBar.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-23
